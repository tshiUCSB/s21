Hey there, I am Tina and I'm excited to be working with you this quarter! I am a third year who is working towards a CS and Art double major. It might seem like an odd combination at first, but they just happen to be the two areas that pique my interest and spark creativity. I find them to be a challenging yet fun process, which motivated me to become a tutor to share the experience. In addition, I hack at hackathons and I am one of the co-leads for SB Hacks, your very own on-campus hackathon. They are valuable opportunities to push yourself to learn something new and get started on a project in a short time. If you are interested in being involved in one or simply would like to chat, approach me and let me know. Thanks, and enjoy CS190J!
