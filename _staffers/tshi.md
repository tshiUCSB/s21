Hey there, I am Tina and I'm excited to be working with you this quarter! I am a third year who is working towards a CS and Art double major. I am passionate about coding and design. In my art studies, I've been focusing on media arts, looking for ways to connect art and technology. In addition, I hack at hackathons and I am one of the co-directors for SB Hacks, your very own on-campus hackathon. They are valuable opportunities to push yourself to learn something new and get started on a project in a short time. If you are interested in being involved in one or simply would like to chat, feel free to approach me and let me know. Thanks, and enjoy CS190J!
